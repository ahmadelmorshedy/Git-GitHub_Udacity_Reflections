* How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

If the Bug is in the new version only, it's probably due to a typo or a missing command
from last version, diff helps me in the way it makes easier and faster finding the changes
I've made to the working version

* How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps you compare file versions and learn about how a new feature is added or how a specific functionality is approved

* What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions  
  automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The advantages is that you have the ability to save commits that have logical meaning + that works without crashes + that have an accompanying commit message, but the problem may occur if someone uses a bad routine such as saving too much or too big commits

* Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google 
  Docs, treat each file separately?

Git handles different files as one repository, and it assumes the files in one repository belongs to one projject, hence interrelated to each others somehow, while Google Docs treats a file as a single Document independent oof others

* How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use git log to:
1. see the commits message
2. specify the commits ids to use in git diff

then using git diff, I can see a whole trace of additions/deletions among commits

* How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

i won't be afraid of making changes that might cause something to break, cause in any time i can return to a previous commit version, or compare my history to find the error

* Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Implementing and Developping my projects/websites/any code I write or test
